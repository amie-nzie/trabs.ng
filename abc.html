                        ABC Transport Company
                    </h5>

                    <p class = "small">ABC Transport Plc commenced operation in road passenger transportation on February 13, 1993 as an off-shoot of Rapido Ventures with a view to running a modern road transportation system in Nigeria.

                        In March 2003, Capital Alliance Private Equity (CAPE) acquired 30% shares of ABC Transport. With the acquisition, Capital Alliance (Nigeria) became stakeholders in ABC TRANSPORT, a partnership that re-positioned the company for greater performance.
                        
                        For the company's remarkable achievement in transportation, ABC Transport was adjudged the Best Transporter in Nigeria by the Chartered Institute of Transport, Nigeria and has since then consistently won the National Bus Operator of the Year Award along with other accolades by renowned bodies.
                        
                        The operations within and outside Nigeria are carried out in ultra modern terminals, with comfortable lounges in various cities like Lagos (Jibowu & Amuwo-Odofin), Aba, Owerri, Port-Harcourt, Abuja, Enugu, Onitsha, Umuahia, Jos, Mbaise, Bolade, and Accra (Ghana).
                        
                        ABC buses are dubbed with the company's trademark the Reindeer. The choice of the Reindeer as the company's symbol was made after a careful study of the peculiarities of the animal which is strong, fast and moves in herds.
                        
                        ABC Transport operates luxury bus services according to accepted international standards of road transportation. Its services are specially designed for distinguished travellers who would otherwise use air service.</p>
